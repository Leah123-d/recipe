    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>For the sweet sticky rice:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice by placing it in a mixing bowl and cover with cold water, then vigorously swish the rice with your hand to release loose starch. Pour off the cloudy water and repeat the process 4 more times or until the water runs mostly clear.
            1 cup white glutinous rice</li>
       <li>Soak the rice with room temp water for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. If you're using naturally dyed water to soak the rice, refrigerate the rice after 4 hours of soaking if you're not yet ready to steam.</li>
       <li>Drain the rice very well, shaking off excess water in a sieve until there is no more dripping. Line a steamer rack with moist muslin (not soaking wet!) or a thin white tea towel and place the rice on the cloth. Fold the edges of the 
        cloth over the rice, making sure the rice doesn't cover the entire rack - there should be space around the rice to allow steam to come up.</li>
       <li>While the rice is cooking, make the coconut syrup. Combine the coconut milk, sugar, and salt in a small pot. If you have a pandan leaf handy, tie it into a knot and throw it in for extra aroma. Cook it over medium heat, and as soon as it starts to bubble, turn off the heat and cover. You will need to reheat this once the rice is ready.</li>
       <li>Few minutes before the rice is done, reheat the syrup so it is steaming hot then keep covered. When the rice is done, immediately place the rice into a mixing bowl and immediately pour the syrup over the rice. Stir to break up any lumps, then cover with a lid, a plate, or aluminum foil and let sit for 20 minutes.</li>
       <li>After 20 minutes, use a rubber spatula to fold the bottom part of the rice up to the top to help redistribute the syrup, and let sit for at least another 20 minutes or until ready to serve. At this stage the rice will keep at room temp all day.</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>For the salted coconut sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir the rice flour into the water until there are no more lumps.
            1 teaspoon rice flour,1 Tablespoon water</li>
        <li>Combine the rice flour slurry, coconut milk, and salt in a small pot. Cook over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl. Let cool completely before serving.
            ½ cup coconut milk,¼ teaspoon table salt</li>
        
    </ol>
